suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more comprehensive error handling, such as handling FileNotFoundError in `get_words_from_file`.
- For improved readability in the JSON exercise, you could separate the steps (loading, accessing, modifying, saving) with comments or blank lines.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately and completely solves both exercises as described in the Chapter Content/Questions. It implements the random sentence generator and correctly manipulates the JSON data, covering all specified requirements.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to understand. Function and variable names are descriptive. Docstrings are included, although they could be slightly more detailed.
- performance: The code is reasonably performant for the given tasks.  `random.choices` is a good choice for selecting multiple random elements. File operations are straightforward.
- security: The code doesn't involve any external input that could pose a security risk. File operations are simple reads and writes.
