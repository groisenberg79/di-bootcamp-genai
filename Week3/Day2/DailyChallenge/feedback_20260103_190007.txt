suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding docstrings to methods for better documentation.
- The type hinting is good; maintain consistency throughout the code.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code correctly implements all the required functionalities as described in the Chapter Content/Questions, including class definition, init method, get_visible_items, navigation methods, custom exception handling, and method chaining. The provided test cases are also handled correctly.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to understand. Good use of descriptive variable names. The comments included from the problem description, while helpful during development, should be removed for final submission.
- performance: The code uses efficient slicing and indexing operations, and the calculations are straightforward. No significant performance bottlenecks are apparent.
- security: The code doesn't appear to have any significant security vulnerabilities. Input validation is present in `go_to_page` to prevent out-of-bounds access.
