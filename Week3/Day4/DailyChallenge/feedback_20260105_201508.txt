suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding a docstring to the class and methods to improve readability.
- The type hints are good; ensure consistency in using them throughout the code.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements all the required functionalities as described in the chapter content, including creating a Circle class with radius/diameter initialization, area computation, dunder methods for string representation, addition, comparison, and sorting. The decorator usage for radius and diameter is also correctly implemented. Therefore, the correctness is 100%.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to follow. The use of descriptive variable names and clear logic enhances readability. Minor improvements could be made with more comprehensive docstrings. Hence the readability score is 95%
- performance: The code is efficient and performs well for the given tasks. The rounding of float values to two decimal places is a good practice. Therefore the performance score is 95%
- security: The code does not involve any external input or operations that could pose a security risk. Type hints are used effectively, contributing to safer code. Therefore, the security score is 100%.
