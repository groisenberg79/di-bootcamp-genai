# 🌟 Exercise 2: Tuple
# Key Python Topics:

# Tuples (immutability)


# Instructions:

# Given a tuple of integers, try to add more integers to the tuple.
# Hint: Tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed after creation. Think about why you can’t add more integers to a tuple.

my_tuple = (1,2, 3)
print(f"initial tuple: {my_tuple}")

my_tuple += (4, 5, 6)
print(f"final tuple: {my_tuple}")
