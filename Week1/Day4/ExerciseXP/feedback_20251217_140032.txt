suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding more comments to explain complex logic, especially in Exercise 4 regarding float generation, to improve readability.
- In Exercise 6, you can directly use the `not` operator to simplify the conditional check: `if not user_name.isdigit() and len(user_name) >= 3:`.
Brief justification:
- correctness: All exercises are completed correctly and address the instructions outlined in the chapter content. The code demonstrates understanding of sets, tuples, lists, loops, and conditional statements, along with input and output operations. The bonus part of exercise 9, whilst incomplete, does follow the prompt.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to follow. Clear variable names and comments enhance understanding. Print statements are used effectively to display intermediate results and final outputs.
- performance: The code performs efficiently for the given tasks. The use of appropriate data structures and algorithms ensures reasonable execution time, even with larger inputs.
- security: The code is generally secure, with no apparent vulnerabilities. Input validation in Exercise 6 helps prevent potential issues with invalid user input. However, there are no explicit security threats addressed in the exercises.
