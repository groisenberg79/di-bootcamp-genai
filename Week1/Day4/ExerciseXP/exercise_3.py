# 🌟 Exercise 3: List Manipulation
# Key Python Topics:

# Lists
# List methods: append, remove, insert, count, clear


# Instructions:

# You have a list: basket = ["Banana", "Apples", "Oranges", "Blueberries"]
# Remove "Banana" from the list.
# Remove "Blueberries" from the list.
# Add "Kiwi" to the end of the list.
# Add "Apples" to the beginning of the list.
# Count how many times "Apples" appear in the list.
# Empty the list.
# Print the final state of the list.

basket = ["Banana", "Apples", "Oranges", "Blueberries"]
basket.remove("Banana")
basket.remove("Blueberries")
basket.append("Kiwi")
basket.insert(0, "Apples")

num_apples = basket.count("Apples")
print(f"number of apples: {num_apples}")

print(f"fruit basket in initial state: {basket}")

basket.clear()
print(f"fruit basket final state: {basket}")
