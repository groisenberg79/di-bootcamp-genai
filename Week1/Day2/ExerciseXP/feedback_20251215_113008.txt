Brief justification:
- correctness: All exercises are implemented correctly and directly address the instructions provided in the chapter content. Each exercise fulfills the specific requirements outlined in its respective problem description.
- readability: The code is well-formatted, uses descriptive variable names, and includes comments that explain each section. This makes the code easy to understand and follow.
- performance: The code is efficient and performs the required tasks without any unnecessary overhead. The solutions are straightforward and optimized for their specific purposes.
- security: The code uses input validation where appropriate (e.g., Exercise 7 converts user input to an integer), minimizing potential security risks. There are no apparent security vulnerabilities.
