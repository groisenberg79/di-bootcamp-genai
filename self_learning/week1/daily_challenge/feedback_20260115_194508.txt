Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately addresses the problems presented in the instructions. It counts the number of actors in the table using `SELECT COUNT(actor_id) FROM actors` and it demonstrates the outcome of attempting to insert a new actor with blank fields by trying to insert a row without the 'birthdate' field. The resulting error message is also displayed, showing the violation of the NOT NULL constraint.
- readability: The code is very readable. The SQL commands are clear and well-formatted, and comments are used effectively to explain the intention and outcome of the operations.
- performance: The code performs the task efficiently as it only involves simple counting and insertion operations.
- security: The SQL code appears to be secure. The insert statement includes specific columns which reduces the risk of accidentally inserting data into incorrect columns. However, it's important to note that SQL injection vulnerabilities could be present if the SQL were constructed dynamically using user inputs.
