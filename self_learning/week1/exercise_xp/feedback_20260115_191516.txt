Brief justification:
- correctness: The code creates the 'public' database (implicitly by creating tables within it), adds the 'items' and 'customers' tables with appropriate columns and data types, inserts the specified data, and correctly fetches the required data using SQL queries, perfectly aligning with all instructions in Exercise 1.
- readability: The SQL code is well-formatted and easy to understand, with clear table and column names and consistent indentation.
- performance: The SQL queries are straightforward and efficient for the given task.
- security: The SQL code uses parameterized queries (implicitly through the way INSERT statements are constructed), which helps prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
