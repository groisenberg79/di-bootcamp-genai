suggestions for improvement:
- Consider moving the file reading to a class variable to avoid re-reading it every time an instance is created.
- The `is_anagram` method can be optimized by sorting the words and comparing them. This is generally faster than using dictionaries for counting, especially for shorter words.

suggestions for improvement:
- This file contains a list of English words, which is fine, however, the provided instructions mentions that it must be within a ZIP file not a TXT file.  Make sure that this is contained within a zip file
- This is data and not code, so there's no meaningful way to evaluate it based on the instructions. Therefore the correctness has to be 0.
Correctness: 0.0%
