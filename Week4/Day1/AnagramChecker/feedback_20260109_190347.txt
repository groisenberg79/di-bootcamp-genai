suggestions for improvement:
- Consider handling file loading errors more gracefully (e.g., using try-except blocks).
- The `is_anagram` method is defined as a classmethod but does not use the `cls` argument. It would be better as a staticmethod or an instance method.

suggestions for improvement:
- Consider adding docstrings to the main function and the `execute_user_choice` function to improve readability further.
- Ensure the AnagramChecker class and related files are properly handled (e.g., file paths, exception handling for file operations) for robustness.

suggestions for improvement:
- This submission only presents a text file containing a list of words. It doesn't address any of the programming tasks outlined in the chapter content, such as creating the `AnagramChecker` class or implementing the UI in `anagrams.py`. Therefore, it's irrelevant to the core requirements of the assignment.
- This code part appears to be data for the wordlist, not runnable python code.
- Since this is not code, there is no need for the readability, performance, and security metrics.
- If this file is meant to be downloaded and used, it should be checked to see if it is a valid and comprehensive list.
- This part of the submission is just a data file, not code, so it cannot be reviewed against the coding standards.
- The prompt requested two code files (`anagram_checker.py` and `anagrams.py`) and a word list data file. The other parts need to be code.
- This submission is not code; it appears to be a placeholder or error.  It does not implement any functionality related to the anagram checker program described in the chapter content.
- Provide the actual `anagrams.py` file with the user interface logic to check anagrams.
