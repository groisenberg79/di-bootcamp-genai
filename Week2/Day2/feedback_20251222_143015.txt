suggestions for improvement:
- Consider using a single `main()` function at the end of the script to call all exercise solutions for better organization.
- Add comments explaining the purpose of the `main()` function in each exercise.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements all seven exercises as described in the chapter content. Each function performs its intended task correctly, fulfilling all requirements and bonus tasks where applicable.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to follow. The function names are descriptive, and the code is properly indented. Docstrings are used effectively to explain the purpose of each function. The readability is only slightly decreased by repetitive `main()` functions throughout the script.
- performance: The code is performant. The exercises don't require complex algorithms, and the code executes efficiently. Importing `random` inside the function in Exercise 4 and 7 is not ideal for performance, but acceptable given the scope of the exercise.
- security: The code does not have any known security vulnerabilities. It does not handle external input, so it's not susceptible to injection attacks or other input-related vulnerabilities.
